# 🦴 Bone Fracture Detection & Classification using Vision Transformer

An AI-powered medical imaging system that detects bone fractures and classifies fracture types from X-ray images using deep learning.

🏆 **Achievement:** 2nd Runner-Up — HackBio (Xpecto’26), IIT Mandi

# 📌 Project Overview

Bone fractures are commonly diagnosed through X-ray analysis by radiologists. However, manual diagnosis can be time-consuming and requires expert expertise.

This project presents a **deep learning-based fracture detection system** that:

✔ Detects whether a fracture exists
✔ Classifies fracture types (12 categories)
✔ Generates an AI-based diagnostic report

💡 **Impact:** Helps reduce manual workload and supports faster medical decision-making.

* ✔ Multi-class fracture classification (12 types)
* ✔ Vision Transformer (ViT-Small Patch16 224)
* ✔ AI-generated radiology report
* ✔ Confidence score output
* ✔ Fast inference (~14 ms per image)
* ✔ Clean modular pipeline
* ✔ Frontend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# 🧠 Model Architecture

The system uses:

👉 **Vision Transformer (ViT-Small Patch16 224)**
👉 Trained from scratch (no fracture-pretrained models)

### Why ViT?

* Captures global image relationships
* Handles complex medical patterns
* Modern deep learning approach
